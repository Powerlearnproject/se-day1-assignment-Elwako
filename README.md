Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Sure! Let's take an example of a vague prompt and then improve it to make it clear, specific, and concise.

Vague Prompt:
"Tell me about the climate."

Improved Prompt:
"Provide an overview of the current climate change trends and their impact on coastal cities."

Explanation of Improvement:

1. Clarity:
   - Vague Prompt: The original prompt, “Tell me about the climate,” is ambiguous because it does not specify which aspect of climate or climate change is of interest. It could refer to current weather conditions, historical climate data, climate science, or any other related topic.
   - Improved Prompt: The improved prompt explicitly asks for “current climate change trends” and their “impact on coastal cities,” providing a clear direction on what information is needed.

2. Specificity:
   - Vague Prompt: The original prompt lacks details, which can lead to a broad or unfocused response that might not meet the user's needs.
